Coordinates persistence components\n * like the mutation queue and remote document cache to present a\n * latency-compensated view of stored data.\n *\n * The LocalStore is responsible for accepting mutations from the Sync Engine.\n * Writes from the client are put into a queue as provisional Mutations until\n * they are processed by the RemoteStore and confirmed as having been written\n * to the server.\n *\n * The local store provides the local version of documents that have been\n * modified locally. It maintains the constraint:\n *\n *   LocalDocument = RemoteDocument + Active(LocalMutations)\n *\n * (Active mutations are those that are enqueued and have not been previously\n * acknowledged or rejected).\n *\n * The RemoteDocument (\"ground truth\") state is provided via the\n * applyChangeBatch method. It will be some version of a server-provided\n * document OR will be a server-provided document PLUS acknowledged mutations:\n *\n *   RemoteDocument' = RemoteDocument + Acknowledged(LocalMutations)\n *\n * Note that this \"dirty\" version of a RemoteDocument will not be identical to a\n * server base version, since it has LocalMutations added to it pending getting\n * an authoritative copy from the server.\n *\n * Since LocalMutations can be rejected by the server, we have to be able to\n * revert a LocalMutation that has already been applied to the LocalDocument\n * (typically done by replaying all remaining LocalMutations to the\n * RemoteDocument to re-apply).\n *\n * The LocalStore is responsible for the garbage collection of the documents it\n * contains. For now, it every doc referenced by a view, the mutation queue, or\n * the RemoteStore.\n *\n * It also maintains the persistence of mapping queries to resume tokens and\n * target ids. It needs to know this data about queries to properly know what\n * docs it would be allowed to garbage collect.\n *\n * The LocalStore must be able to efficiently execute queries against its local\n * cache of the documents, to provide the initial set of results before any\n * remote changes have been received.\n *\n * Note: In TypeScript, most methods return Promises since the implementation\n * may rely on fetching data from IndexedDB which is async.\n * These Promises will only be rejected on an I/O error or other internal\n * (unexpected) failure (e.g. failed assert) and always represent an\n * unrecoverable error (should be caught / reported by the async_queue).\n */ var nr = /** @class */ function() {\n    function t(\n    /** Manages our in-memory or durable persistence. */\n    t, e, n) {\n        this.persistence = t, this.xu = e, \n        /**\n             * The set of document references maintained by any local views.\n             */\n        this.Bu = new Re, \n        /**\n             * Maps a targetID to data about its target.\n             *\n             * PORTING NOTE: We are using an immutable data structure on Web to make re-runs\n             * of `applyRemoteEvent()` idempotent.\n             */\n        this.qu = new I(Ie), \n        /** Maps a target to its targetID. */\n        // TODO(wuandy): Evaluate if TargetId can be part of Target.\n        this.Uu = new De((function(t) {\n            return t.canonicalId();\n        })), \n        /**\n             * The read time of the last entry processed by `getNewDocumentChanges()`.\n             *\n             * PORTING NOTE: This is only used for multi-tab synchronization.\n             */\n        this.Qu = m.MIN, this.persistence.yo.Mu(this.Bu), this.ar = t.bu(n), this.Wu = t.Su(), \n        this.Za = t.vu(), this.ju = new Ue(this.Wu, this.ar, this.persistence.Du()), this.xu.Ku(this.ju)\n        /** Starts the LocalStore. */;\n    }\n    return t.prototype.start = function() {\n        return Promise.resolve();\n    }, \n    /**\n     * Tells the LocalStore that the currently authenticated user has changed.\n     *\n     * In response the local store switches the mutation queue to the new user and\n     * returns any resulting document changes.\n     */\n    // PORTING NOTE: Android and iOS only return the documents affected by the\n    // change.\n    t.prototype.Gu = function(t) {\n        return e.__awaiter(this, void 0, void 0, (function() {\n            var n, r, i, o = this;\n            return e.__generator(this, (function(e) {\n                switch (e.label) {\n                  case 0:\n                    return n = this.ar, r = this.ju, [ 4 /*yield*/ , this.persistence.runTransaction(\"Handle user change\", \"readonly\", (function(e) {\n                        // Swap out the mutation queue, grabbing the pending mutation batches\n                        // before and after.\n                        var i;\n                        return o.ar.Uo(e).next((function(s) {\n                            return i = s, n = o.persistence.bu(t), \n                            // Recreate our LocalDocumentsView using the new\n                            // MutationQueue.\n                            r = new Ue(o.Wu, n, o.persistence.Du()), n.Uo(e);\n                        })).next((function(t) {\n                            for (var n = [], o = [], s = Zt(), u = 0, a = i\n                            // Union the old/new changed keys.\n                            ;
